Post-disaster Building Damage Detection in Satellite Images

Identifying damaged building after disaster is a vital task for rescue agents in order to supply the first aid to the victims. Conventional methods involve manual extraction of information from aerial images to detect the damaged buildings. However, this method is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, automating the task is inevitable. In this study, we used xBD, a very recent disaster imagery dataset, and developed a multi-path neural network along with a Siamese network for detection of building damage caused due to natural disasters. Both methods performed better than baseline that we established using a very simple CNN architecture. The model that performed better was the multi-path network which had a test set accuracy of 60.10%.
